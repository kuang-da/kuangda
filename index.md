I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of [Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/graduate/program-offerings/doctoral-program/), University of Pennsylvania, advised by Professor [Junhyong Kim](https://kim.bio.upenn.edu/).

## Research

My research interests center around single-cell genomics, machine learning, and information retrieval.

## Projects

- 2019 - 2020, Resistant Fit Normalization for Single-cell RNA Sequencing Data.
- 2018 - 2019, Consensus Analysis to Identify Novel Gene Candidates in T Cell Differentiation.
- 2017 - 2018, Identify differential chromatin interactions in Hi-C data with triplet convolutional neural network HiCComp

## Reading

- While there is much great material on StackOverflow and Medium to pick up new skills, I still believe reading books is one of the best ways to be an expert.

- I am a [Tsundoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku) reader who tends to collect more books than I could ever finish.

- Here is a [list of readings](readings.md), which I finished and would like to recommend to friends.

## Writing

I have a [Medium Blog](https://kuangda-derek.medium.com/) to take notes on my reflections and explorations.

## Miscellaneous

I have a small side project to organize some interesting historical milstones in different field on the same timeline. I may consider adding some visualizaiton but now it just a Google Sheet.
