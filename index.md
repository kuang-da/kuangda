## Research

My research interests center around single-cell genomics, machine learning, and information retrieval.

## Projects

- 2019 - 2020, Resistant Fit Normalization for Single-cell RNA Sequencing Data.
- 2018 - 2019, Consensus Analysis to Identify Novel Gene Candidates in T Cell Differentiation.
- 2017 - 2018, Identify differential chromatin interactions in Hi-C data with triplet convolutional neural network HiCComp

## Talks and Presentations

- [Journal Clubs](journal-clubs.md)

## Reading

- I am working on a [reading list of Single-cell genomics](https://publish.obsidian.md/single-cell-papers/README).

- I am a [Tsundoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku) reader who tends to collect more books than I could ever finish. Here is a [list of my book collection](https://www.notion.so/e510f753fbeb4c7fab65aae19e22d073?v=f8b214cd7f584da5b7d3846f40224cae).

## Writing

I have a [Medium Blog](https://kuangda-derek.medium.com/) to take notes on my reflections and explorations.

## Miscellaneous

I have a small side project to organize some interesting historical milstones in different field on the same timeline. I may consider adding some visualizaiton but now it just a Google Sheet.
